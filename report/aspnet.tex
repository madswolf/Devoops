We chose ASP.Net as our framework for the web application for multiple reasons: Support, maturity and familiarity. ASP.Net also provides built-in support for many things that we will need, including but not limited to: session management, object-relational mapping, model-view-controller design pattern, security and server-side rendering.

Appendix A (\ref{languagechoice}) is a more in-depth discussion of different languages and frameworks, and Appendix C (\ref{scriptinglanguages}) is a description of the scripting languages we used in CI/CD.

\begin{description}
\item [Support] In 2021, the most popular non-JavaScript web framework was ASP.NET Core
\cite{so_market_share}). As ASP.NET Core is currently one of the largest web frameworks, there is a large amount of support available, as the community is very active and it is usually easier to troubleshoot problems, as someone likely has had the same issues before.
\item [Maturity] ASP.Net has been in development for 20 years, and has become solid software that will reliably fit into most tech stacks.
\item [Familiarity] A less technical reason for choosing ASP.Net is that the group was already familiar with it, which would likely reduce development time
