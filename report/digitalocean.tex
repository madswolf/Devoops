For this project, we picked Digital Ocean as the cloud provider to host both the application and other necessary infrastructure, as well as the PostgreSQL database. 

In the group, we have members who have either used Amazon Web Services, Azure or Digital Ocean before. These three were therefore the main competitors in our optics.

Amazon Web Services and Azure provides a lot of different services that Digital Ocean does not. In return, Digital Ocean is (in our eyes) much more user friendly for non-experts, where the AWS dashboard and Azure portal can be a mouthful. Digital Ocean has an easy to understand interface with one-click deployments, as well as an intuitive API which can be invoked with a token. \\

\noindent In the end it came down to the fact that we each had \$100 of free credit for Digital Ocean's services.
