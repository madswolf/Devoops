We have been using shell, as it is the standard on all ubuntu systems, which make most of the currently running servers. Furthermore, all of the most important CLI commands are also ported into Powershell, so it is quite easy to to run those scripts on windows. The shell scripts are extremely useful, when we have to do system wide operations such as installing a program or setting up a development environment. They also come in handy when we need to use some CLI tools such as the ones for building our web application or running the tests.
