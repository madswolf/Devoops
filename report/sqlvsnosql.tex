\subsubsection{SQL vs NoSQL} 
In recent times, there is a huge debate over whether to use SQL or NoSQL databases with web applications. There are a lot of advantages to using either structure. NoSQL databases are often used when working with big datasets that need to scale well. NoSQL offers great support for unstructured data that can be accessed quickly. On the other hand, the standard SQL keeps the database in a consistent state, and provides a high amount of integrity, which we find more important than scalability in this project. Another important factor is that the previous database from the MiniTwit Python was also a SQL one, which would makes the transition to another SQL-based solution much easier.
