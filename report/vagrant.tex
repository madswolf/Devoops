For this project we have opted for using Vagrant as a virtual machine provisioning tool. It is \textit{lightweight} in the sense that you only need a "vagrantfile" to provision a new cloud hosted virtual machine, and run an initialization script on it - essentially deploying the service from nothing by running a single file. This was initially a very attractive choice, as this file can simply be shared over GitHub, and any team member or deployment service would be able to provision and start the application. While a Docker image of the web server might have taken more initial set-up of containerizing the application, had we been able, we would probably have switched to Docker, because of maturity issues with Vagrant. Vagrant is not as common as Docker, and thus not available out-of-the-box for services like GitHub Actions, and with limited support/issues with Digital Ocean.
